# Handwritten_n-digit_Classification-CNN
This model uses Convolutional neural network to classify the handwritten Digits The dataset has been taken from the MNIST(The smaller dataset of the NIST)

The accuracy of the model is 99%

# Update
The Data Augmentation is implemented to reduce the further OverFitting

# Result
Before Data Augmentation the val-accuracy achieved in the training process is Max(99%)

But After the Data Augmentation the Val-accuracy is acheived upto 99.21%

While the Accuracy of the model on the test remain 99% for the both.
