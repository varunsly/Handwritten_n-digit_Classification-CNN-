# Handwritten_n-digit_Classification-CNN
This model uses Convolutional neural network to classify the handwritten Digits The dataset has been taken from the MNIST(The smaller dataset of the NIST)

The accuracy of the model is 99%

# Update
The Data Augmentation is implemented to reduce the further OverFitting
